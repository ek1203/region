# Region-specific function prediction
This repository contains MATLAB scripts and feature sets for "Towards region-specific propagation of protein functions" by D.C. Emily Koo and R. Bonneau.

## Scripts
demo_script.m - a demo script on a small dataset to make sure that the script runs correctly.

## Running
To run the demo, download all the files and scripts and run 'demo_script' in MATLAB in the main project directory. 
A 'results' directory will be created to store the output demo_output_last.mat file generated by the script. 

## Dependencies
The scripts should be run on MATLAB versions 2017 and above and requires the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

## Data
data/demo_data.mat - contains all the necessary data to run the demo script.
